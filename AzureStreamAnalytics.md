# Add Input stream from blob storage to azure stream analytics

Because of App Version problem I tried to add an input stream to azure stream analytics.
In JSON file development for defining/Creating a Azure stream Input, one thing must be considered. Some attributes are related with eachother.
For example
"pathPattern":"test-blob_2324jklj/PageViews/{date}/{time}",
"dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD",
             "timeFormat":"HH"
